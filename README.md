## 🧠 Problem Statement
Fattening pigs is a costly process. Can we predict the final weight of a pig after fattening using only information available *before* slaughter — such as initial weight before fattening period, feed intake during the fattening period, and the fattening duration? If so, farmers could better estimate:
- Profitability
- Feeding plans
- Ideal selling time
